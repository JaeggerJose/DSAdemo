# Leetcode 1381 Design a Stack With Increment Operation

## Discription

Design a stack which supports the following operations.

Implement the CustomStack class:

- **CustomStack(int maxSize)** Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack or do nothing if the stack reached the maxSize.
- **void push(int x)** Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack hasn't reached the maxSize.
- **int pop()** Pops and returns the top of stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
- **void inc(int k, int val)** Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, just increment all the elements in the stack.
